<h3>Make Nashville website</h3>
<p>I designed and built <a href="https://github.com/kenziebottoms/makenashville" target="blank">a custom, responsive FoundationPress theme</a> for <a href="http://makenashville.org" target="blank">Make Nashville</a>, a local organization dedicated to providing creative resources and space to makers of all kinds, and am currently in the process of rebranding existing materials to match the site more closely.</p>
